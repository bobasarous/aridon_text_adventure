# aridon_text_adventure v0.0.01-0

# Aridon is a world where most intelligent creatures are good hearted and nice, even goblins, bugbears, and the like. But that is all on the material plane, from the other realms seeps chaos, evil, and destruction. Dragons who bow to devious gods,
# Devils coming from the 9 hells, and gods who seek only to rule by fear and oppression. In Aridon you will have free reign like in DnD, to make your character, choose who you want to be, and make your way in the world, choosing your own path.

# Version naming scheme-
# v0- Major release v1.0.0.00-0 or just v1 will be the full release of the first version of the game
# v0.1 Minor release, releases of this nature will be decent sized addons, new content, playable races, classes, npcs, areas, but not large enough to be an entire new version of the game
# v0.0.1 Beta release (and the smallest "full releases") of minor releases, mostly bug free, but still being worked on, and will be small chunks of what inevitably will become minor releases
# v0.0.01 Non-release build of release betas, either too many bugs, too little content, or something wrong in general, or just new additions (although these will still appear on git/github, but not meant to be taken as full builds and could still very much be buggy)
# v0.0.00-1 Bug-Release, isn't an extra build number per se, and can appear on top of any build number so it could look like this  v2.3.46-3, it just symbolizes that the previous version had overlooked bugs or problems and the release/work of newer content was being halted until it was worked on
