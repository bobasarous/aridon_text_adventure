# aridon_text_adventure v0.0.01-0

# Aridon is a world where most intelligent creatures are good hearted and nice, even goblins, bugbears, and the like. But that is all on the material plane, from the other realms seeps chaos, evil, and destruction. Dragons who bow to devious gods,
# Devils coming from the 9 hells, and gods who seek only to rule by fear and oppression. In Aridon you will have free reign like in DnD, to make your character, choose who you want to be, and make your way in the world, choosing your own path.

# Version naming scheme-
# v1- Major/final release ex.-v1.0.0.00-0/v1 When a whole major arc/section of game is complete and it alone is a full game (will attempt to be bugfree on release)
# v0.1 Large content release ex.-v0.0.0.00-0/v0.1 sections of content that will make up a full section of the game, that alone are not/could not be standalone games or major parts of the game (will attempt to be bugfree on release)
# v0.0.1 Beta release ex.-v0.0.1.00-0/v0.0.1 (smallest "full releases") Minor releases, either uncompleted tiny sections of the game that need to be worked on, or very very tiny parts of the game that are not big enough to even be decent content. (will attempt to be bugfree on release but no promises)
# v0.0.0.01 non-release ex.-v0.0.0.01-0/v0.0.0.01 Either too small, or uncompleted, or too buggy to release, might be noticable number in larger releases, and may sometimes be released to just make working parity with something else, or maybe just a couple lines of code changed.
# v0.0.0.00-1 Bug-Release ex.-v0.0.0.00-1 Simply a bug fix, no matter how big, a release of this is simply to fix bugs, there will never be new content, only fixed bugs.
